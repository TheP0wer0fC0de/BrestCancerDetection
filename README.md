Classifies Ultrasound Images 
In order for this project to work, the first thing that must be done is to download the image data from Kaggle. The link for the data will be provided in the credits section of the readme file. After the data is downloaded, it must be uploaded to your google drive. Then you will need to change the path of the file’s location by altering line 2 of block 5 where it says “ path = “.

You must change the file pathname to match where you stored the dataset. Finally, when you first run the code, block 4 will try to connect to your Google Drive. Before the code can finish compiling, it will provide a link that you must click on.

This link will ask you to sign on to your google account. After successfully signing in, it will provide another link which is the authorization code that you will have to copy and paste into the window provided on block 4.

Once the link is copied into the window, press “enter” for the code to continue compiling.
